## Visualize algorithms & data structures step-by-step

## Description

An open-source algorithm visualizer built for ITI (Information Technology Institute) - Alexandria, Open Source Application Development Department, Intake 45. This project provides an interactive way to visualize various algorithms, making it easier to understand their behavior and efficiency.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms:**
  - **Bubble Sort:** A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass-through process is repeated until the list is sorted.
  - **Selection Sort:** A comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the array and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms:**
  - **A\* Search:** An informed search algorithm used for pathfinding and graph traversal. It finds the shortest path from a starting node to a target node using heuristics to optimize the search.
- **Searching Algorithms:**
  - **Linear Search:** A simple search algorithm that checks each element in a list sequentially until the target element is found or the list ends.
  - **Binary Search:** A more efficient search algorithm that works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target value is found.
- **Other Algorithms:**
  - **Prefix Sum:** A technique that precomputes the cumulative sum of an array to allow efficient range sum queries in constant time.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using the following technologies:

- **JavaScript (ES6):** Provides the core logic and interactivity.
- **HTML:** Structures the application interface.
- **CSS:** Styles and enhances the visual representation of the algorithms.
