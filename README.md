## ✨ Key Features

### 📊 Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort:** Visualize pairwise comparisons and swaps to sort elements in ascending/descending order.
- **Selection Sort:** Observe the selection of the smallest element and its placement in the sorted subarray.
- **Quick Sort:** Track the divide-and-conquer approach with pivot partitioning for efficient sorting.

### 🔍 Searching Algorithms
- **Linear Search:** Follow sequential checks to locate a target element in an unsorted array.
- **Binary Search:** Explore the divide-and-conquer strategy in a sorted array with logarithmic time complexity.

### 🛤️ Pathfinding Algorithms
- **A\* Search:** Discover optimal paths using heuristic-driven graph traversal between start and end nodes.

### 🌳 Data Structures
- **Binary Search Tree (BST):** Visualize insertion, deletion, and search operations in a self-balancing tree structure.

### 🔢 Mathematical Algorithms
- **Sieve of Eratosthenes:** Step through prime number identification by iteratively eliminating multiples.
- **Pascal's Triangle:** Generate and explore binomial coefficients in a triangular array format.

### ⚡ Algorithmic Techniques
- **Sliding Window:** Analyze efficient subarray/substring computations with a dynamic window size.
- **Prefix Sum:** Precompute cumulative sums to enable constant-time range sum queries.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **JavaScript (ES6):** Core logic for algorithm visualization and interactivity.
- **HTML5:** Structure and layout of the web interface.
- **CSS3:** Styling, animations, and responsive design.
